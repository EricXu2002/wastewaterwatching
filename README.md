# wastewaterwatching

### Authors:
Ethan Don, Max Shi, and Eric Xu

## Goals:

We wanted to make a web app that lets customers easily obtain and understand information about the wastewater disposal process and how it affects them, as well as need to be able to share information with others and see information that is shared by others. Our website will provide geographic data, a newsfeed for relevant news, and a moderated forum for users to share and discuss information about these topics.
